# 3015-CW1-OpenGL-Assignment
This is my submission for COMP3015 - Coursework 1. I have created an OpenGL scene which has a custom model loaded with a mix of textures displayed on it, BlinnPhong lighting, Toonshading, normal map and a skybox.
The theme of the scene is meant to be a cave-like experience - the background is dark and there is a cavern structure model loaded with moss on it.
